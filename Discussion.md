# To Discuss: 

1. Why do we load list of articles in single article page ? ( cached )
2. Error Command failed with signal "SIGSEGV". after some paginating
3. Duplicate requests on the backend ?
    - Example: 
       get Comments of Article ID 32265
       getSingleArticle ID 32265
       getArticles page 2

    - Future work, good plan to review requests before we release new code.
4.  Load all comments and all single articles for far paginated articles, could be extra overload.
5. Typescript ? 
6. .env & hard coded urls. 
7. How to handle multi tenant system with next js ?
8. Next js & CDN ?
